# weristdas
Wer ist das? is a multiplayer buzzer game inspired by the german tv show 'Schlag den Raab'.

An image is shown on the display and the player who buzzers first can tell within 5 seconds who he thinks is displayed. The host/referee decides if the answer is correct and assingns points accordingly.

All you need is a repository with images files of 'famous' persons which filenames contain the solution as follows: the file 'George_Clooney.jpg will display the solution 'George Clooney'.

The settings are configured for a Playstation Buzz! Controller and a Keyboard for the referee, but you can modify acording to you needs and the devices you have available.

The game is programmed using pygame.
